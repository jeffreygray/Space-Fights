# Welcome!!!!
Space Fights is an invigorating multiplayer space shooter that won "Best Overall Game" at UVA's game expo in Spring 2017 by a panel of faculty judges with industry experience in Game design and the student body.

## Energy
Energy usage in Space Fights distinguishes it from other games in the genre. Most gamers are accustomed to separate weapon cooldowns, shields, health, and repair mechanics; however, Space Fights integrates all of this into one attribute. A blue bar above your ship indicates the current energy of the ship. This value decreases when firing a weapon, receiving damage, or using the Rhino's speed boost. This renders PvP as a fast-paced mind game since you donâ€™t want to accidentally overshoot. Doing so would make you vulnerable to a 1-shot kill because your energy drains by firing projectiles. Each of the different ship classes has their own base energy balanced with respect to their combat abilities.

## Current Classes
* Vulture (nimble ONE-shot assassin)
* Lion (slothy bullet tank)
* Rhino (physical damage focused ramming ship)

## Controller Requirements: 
Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, Start

Note that you can configure whatever controllers you so desire for Space Fights; alternatively, you can simply remap the inputs to keyboard buttons. Simply edit the GamePad.java file to correspond with your desired interaction style.
